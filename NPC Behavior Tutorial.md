# NPC Behavaior Tutorial
In this tutorial I will teach you how to create an NPC (non playable charater) and have it move in a 2D game. First thing to do is create the npc by going to the hierarchy (left side) and right click. Once you right click many options appear and you need to go down to 2D object and once clicked more options appear and press Sprites. After that, even more options will appear. Go to square be thats what i will be using. Name the square npc and in the top of its inspector (right side) and so to Layer. Create a new layer called NPC because it will be important afterwards.
