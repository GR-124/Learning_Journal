# Main Menu Tutorial

In this tutorial I will teach you how to create a main menu and have it move in a 2D game. The first thing to do is to create a new scene and its done by right clicking in the project area and press create then scroll down to scene. The new scene will be empty and so first you create a button by right clicking in the hiearchary and scrolling down to UI. press UI then scroll down and select Button-TextMeshPro. Name that button start. You name the button on the scene by pressing the triangle thats next to your button on the hierachry and underneath will appear the option called, Text (TMP). When pressed, the inspector shows the option called TextMeshPro-Text (UI) and thats where you can name your start button.
