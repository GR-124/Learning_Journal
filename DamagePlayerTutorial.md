In this tutorial i will show you how to make a Damage Player script. Before i start you should know a Health controller script is needed so you can reference it in this script.
If you don't have one thats fine i will (or already have) make a tutorial for one as well. First thing you do is make sure you have a player, ground and for now just add an empty object  
that will be what will damage your player (i'll be using a  different colour square because my player is just a  green square).
