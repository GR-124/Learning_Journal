3 of my tutorials are connected and i have to keep referencing them. Solution: i will combine them but its gonna be long :( 

when combining the 3 scripts, one references a 4th script so now i have to add it to the tutorial so that means more work :(. Solution: just do it 

when in test game to test scripts, the player disappears and idk why. Solution: i put the respawn controller script in the player and in the respawn manager and so they deleted eachother, i just took the scrpit out of the player and it was fixed.

in my npc script i dont remember what move rate means. Solution: i remembered. its how long (in seconds) the npc waits till it moves agaon after moving so it can move again.

npc would stop moving at random and its speed was random. Solution: i changed the random range from -1, 1 to -2, 2 because it would include the numbers between like 1 and -1.

i forgot what the x and y axis control. Solution: i remembered by moving objects on unity. x axis is for moving horizotaly and y axis
is for moving vertically

i forgot what GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); means. Solution: i googled it and found out it allows you to access rigidbody components

i dont know what Lerp means. Solution: i googled it but did not understand so i looked on reddit and they explained better. Lerping changes the value of on object for where it was to where it moved to.

started doing script for shooting but vid im following dont make sense. Solution: i found a better video and also used some of my own knowledge. i ended up not finishing this script and instead make a different script because the shooting script didn't make sense for my 
proto type game.

unity don't understand script but the script is perfectly fine. Solution: the problem was in unity. it worked after i removed and add the script back in.
