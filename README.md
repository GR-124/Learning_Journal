3 of my tutorials are connected and i have to keep referencing them. Solution: imma combine them but its gonna be long :(

when in test game to test scripts, the player disappears and idk why. Solution: i put the respawn controller script in the player and in the respawn manager and so they deleted eachother, i just took the scrpit out of the player and it was fixed.

in my npc script i dont remember what move rate means. Solution: i remembered. its how long (in seconds) the npc waits till it moves agaon after moving so it can move again.

npc would stop moving at random and its speed was random. Solution: i changed the random range from -1, 1 to -2, 2 because it would include the numbers between like 1 and -1.
